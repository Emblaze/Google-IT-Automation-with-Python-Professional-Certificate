<p>Merge conflicts are not uncommon when working in a team of developers, or on Open Source Software. Fortunately, GitHub has some good documentation on how to handle them when they happen:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing">git rebase branchname</a> to change the base of the current branch to be branchname</p>
<p>The git rebase command is a lot more powerful.  Check out <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">this link</a> for more information.</p>
