# Problem-solving Framework

When we take the structured approach to tackling problems there really isn't a challenge too complex to solve

## Problem Statement

Before we jump into solving that problem, we need to know what information we'll use as input and what information we'll have as output. We can work this out by looking at the rest of the system where our script will live. Wwe need to know exact names of the attributes, otherwise, we won't be able to access them.

When working on a problem in general, and it's solution, it's easy to get caught up in the "making it look good" part. It's better to first focus on making the program work. You can always spend time making the report look nice later.
