<h3 id="finding-your-path-and-perfect-role">Finding your Path and Perfect Role</h3>
<p>As you begin your career, you’ll have to navigate your way to find the perfect role for you. While there is no one way to find your ideal role, there are some things to consider to help you better understand what direction you want to take. This reading will focus on a few of the options to consider as you start to search for a job.</p>
<h4 id="generalist-vs-specialist">Generalist vs specialist</h4>
<p>One category to consider when attempting to find your right path is whether you want to work as a generalist or a specialist. A <strong>generalist</strong> is knowledgeable about many topics and has various interests, while a <strong>specialist</strong> is an expert in a specific field.</p>
<p>Generalists have broad, multifaceted roles that allow entry-level employees to gain invaluable experience in many different areas related to the field. Alternatively, specialists are focused on a singular aspect of IT. The table below provides an overview of common generalist and specialist roles.</p>
<h5 id="common-generalist-roles">Common Generalist Roles</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IT Support Specialist II</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT Consultant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT Manager</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="common-specialist-roles">Common Specialist Roles</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automation Engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python Developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software Engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud Engineer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the word “specialist” is often used in job titles, even for roles that include generalist-like tasks. When reviewing a job listing, be sure to read the duties and responsibilities assigned to that role so that you have a clear understanding of what you will be doing if hired.</p>
<h4 id="choose-your-work-environment">Choose your work environment</h4>
<p>Choosing what type of environment works best for you is just as important as the type of role you select. Different types of environments have their own cultures and practices. As an entry-level employee, you’ll come across two types of workplaces: agency or in-house. You can also choose to work for yourself in a freelance role or even start your own business.</p>
<h5 id="agency-vs-in-house-teams">Agency vs In-house teams</h5>
<p>In the IT field, there are special agencies that offer IT services and technical personnel to other businesses on a contracted basis. These agencies can support multiple small to medium companies and often operate independently from the businesses they serve. As an entry-level employee in an IT service agency, you can expect to provide services to several clients. Short-term assignments are also common in agency contracts. Agencies may or may not offer employee benefits to their contracted technical personnel.</p>
<p>Alternatively, large companies and enterprises are likely to have an “in-house” team of internal employees to handle their IT needs. Although it is costly to employ an internal IT department, larger businesses prefer to have full transparency with their IT team and full control over the privacy of their users and confidential information. As an entry-level employee in an in-house IT department, you can expect to work closely with an IT team that has a variety of technical skills. It is common to build strong relationships with your team members, as you support one another on long-term projects. Internal IT department employees often hold full-time permanent positions and receive employee benefits.</p>
<h5 id="large-vs-small-companies">Large vs Small Companies</h5>
<p>Having a general idea of what you’re looking for in a work environment will help you narrow down your job search and land opportunities that are a better fit for you. You may prefer to work onsite for a large company for the diverse social atmosphere and professional networking opportunities. Some large companies and enterprises offer onsite cafeterias, gyms, and childcare, in addition to comprehensive employee benefit packages and career path opportunities. Or, you may prefer to work for a smaller company where you can form closer working relationships with smaller teams. You may want to work for a company that offers flexible work schedules and options that allow you to work from home, in the office, or a hybrid between the two.</p>
<h3 id="finding-your-path-and-perfect-role-key-takeaways">Finding your Path and Perfect role Key takeaways</h3>
<p>As you navigate your job search, think about what you want in a career. Establish the types of roles you want to start with and the type of company you want to work for. Over time, your experience will help you make better-informed decisions related to your career direction.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>In the simplest terms, diversity means something that is different from the norm. Diversity in the workplace represents how organizations and their employees connect, engage, and respect people across all types of differences. More companies are beginning to emphasize their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) metrics as a way to stand out from their competitors. Companies with good DEI metrics tend to have higher employee retention rates, more satisfied employees, and increased innovation.</p>
<p>Diversity starts at the very top with a company’s executive leadership. Examine the leadership at the company you want to work for. The people working at the executive level is typically a good indicator of how diverse and well-represented their employees are as well. If a company’s executive leadership does not embrace diversity, the employees will experience greater difficulties in creating and maintaining that culture. Some questions to ask yourself as you are conducting research on companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does the company share their progress openly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they provide education and training opportunities to learn more about DEI and how people in the workplace are impacted?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways to assess whether or not a company practices diversity and inclusion. Here are a few resources to explore and gain better insights on the company:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The company’s website. Assess their core values, history, mission statement, and keywords. See if their website includes any photographs of their employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their social media page(s). What kind of pictures and content do they post publicly? Check for photos of their employees, community outings, whether or not they recognize or celebrate various events or historical moments such as pride month, black history month, or world mental health day as a couple examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interview former employees. Conduct informational interviews to learn more about a company in general and ensure that workplace culture will be a good fit for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unconsciousimplicit-bias">Unconscious/Implicit Bias</h3>
<p>Unconscious or implicit bias refers to the attitudes, stereotypes, judgements, or prejudices that we have unconsciously in our brain. This bias makes our reactions, thinking, and predisposition to information, actions, or environments alter in a particular way, whether it be positive or negative, without self awareness of its occurrence. It occurs beyond our control and could impact our decisions, actions, and understanding.</p>
<p>Unconscious bias is present, to some degree, in every single person and is developed from an early age through the course of one’s life. Unconscious bias is associated with many characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and educational background. Some of the common types of unconscious bias are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Affinity bias, which refers to preferences when choosing people to connect with. These people share similar interests, experiences, and backgrounds to your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attribution bias, which refers to the ways you perceive your actions in comparison to others. This bias is mostly in association with how you perceive success and failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ageism, which refers to negative feelings or discriminations against someone based on their age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beauty bias, which refers to relating a person’s physical appearance to their success, competence, and/or qualifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gender bias, which refers to a preference for one gender over others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ableism bias, which refers to perceiving able-bodied people as the norm and people with disabilities should strive to perform at the same level as able bodied people without necessary accommodations. (examples: reserving a meeting space that is not wheelchair accessible, assuming people have to have a visible disability to be considered disabled, framing disability as something tragic or as an inspiration)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify our own biases, it’s important to know what are some of the causes of unconscious/implicit bias. Bias occurs because, as human beings, we are susceptible to tendencies and are creatures of habit. For example: humans tend to seek patterns, our brains are known to simplify the world, we get influenced by culture and/or media.</p>
<p>The truth is that no matter what the causes are, we are susceptible to implicit bias, and this could affect our relationships at work, the way we behave on certain occasions, the decisions we make, and how we react in our work environment.</p>
<p>The first step that we can take to remediate this behavior is to recognize that we are susceptible to bias and to identify it. The next step is to take actions that reduce the implicit bias at work. Some corrective measures that can be taken are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing education. Educating employers and employees about the different types of unconscious bias and how to recognize it is one of the most effective methods to reduce this bias at work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating an inclusive work environment. Having an inclusive work environment will help to broaden perspectives and balance any prejudices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the types of bias when making decisions. Check your decision for any cultural, racial, ability, or gender stereotypes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dei-key-takeaways">DEI Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are all human, each with our own thoughts and opinions. It is important to recognize we do not all think the same way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unconscious/Implicit Bias is an unavoidable result of being human and can influence daily decisions in our personal and professional lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to be conscientious about unconscious/implicit bias when in the workplace by being open minded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A culture of diversity, equity and inclusion starts with executive leadership in any organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuous education and training is very important and effective for reducing bias at work and promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-career-development-plan">Creating a Career Development Plan</h2>
<p>There are several components and aspects of your potential career to consider while you are job searching. Before embarking on your journey, it is important to outline your career path. Doing so will help you find opportunities that align with your values, interests, and aspirations. As a Python automation developer, you have a myriad of options available to you. Many industries are hiring IT professionals to assist with Python development, debugging code, troubleshooting issues, recommending solutions, and automating processes on cloud platforms and in Linux environments.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-career-goals">Identifying career goals</h3>
<p><strong>What do you want to accomplish as a Python automation professional?</strong> There are multiple specialist fields in the IT industry that will give you the opportunity to further develop and hone your skills in automating with Python. However, you can just as easily take the generalist route and cross-apply your knowledge of Python, cloud computing, and Linux to various roles.</p>
<p><strong>Do you aspire to eventually work in management in any capacity?</strong> If so, it’s important during your job hunt to ask about opportunities for advancement or transition throughout the company. Some companies are limited in opportunities due to long-term employee retention or other factors.</p>
<p><strong>What are your unique strengths and skills that you bring with you to a company?</strong> Identifying your strengths, both soft and hard skills, will help you stand out from other applicants. There are a plethora of transferable skills that you can use to leverage your application. If you’re not sure where to start on identifying your unique strengths and identifying your transferable skills, there are lots of online resources and platforms to help you get an idea.</p>
<p>Skill stacking is becoming more appealing to hiring managers and companies within the field of technology. Skill stacking is when employees combine skills from different fields or industries to produce novel ideas, approaches, and systems. Soft skills are the most important skills to have if you’re considering any position in management or if you want to work in a team-based work environment. Having the skills to hold conversations, navigate conflict, and collaborate with others will highly benefit your career.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-timeline">Creating a timeline</h3>
<p>A common question that is asked in interviews is, “where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?” Creating a timeline for you and your career is helpful in gaining insight into what career opportunities will work best for you moving forward. One helpful way to gain clarity into this is to break down your bigger career goals into smaller goals.</p>
<p>Approach your job search and career in IT with an open mind. Be flexible with deadlines, milestones, and your own personal timeline. Be receptive to potential job opportunities that you might not traditionally apply to or pursue. Adaptability and flexibility are two of the most coveted soft skills employers look for in their employees.</p>
<p>Lastly, hold yourself accountable for your own progress. Technology is always changing and staying informed of all the changes that pertain to your job or specialty will give you an advantage over other employees. Look at taking other certifications, take online courses, read books on the subject, attend conferences, continuously network with other professionals in your field, and/or complete passion projects in your free time. Taking extra measures to inform yourself about your field and attending events with other professionals will greatly increase your chances of success and career satisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="getting-promoted">Getting Promoted</h2>
<p>You may already have a technical job and are building your skills to advance your career. You may be considering asking for a promotion.</p>
<p>You know that you have the Python and automation tools to successfully advance your career. Now is the time to plan for what to do next, with special consideration as to which career path to pursue. Perhaps you’re interested in using your Python skills for analyzing data or developing software. You might be considering using your automation knowledge to streamline the maintenance of a Linux network or cloud environment.</p>
<p>What are the growth opportunities in your organization? Do they support training? Is this a transitional job? Is this your dream job? All these questions must be taken into account when planning your next steps. After you answer those basic questions, you have to prepare and space your next steps accordingly. If you are planning to grow within your organization, there are a few considerations that you should evaluate to get to the place where you want to be.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider when planning for a promotion is performing beyond average at your current position. This means proving to your employer that you are not only capable of doing your actual job, but that you are capable of taking on bigger responsibilities. How do you achieve that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Work on your development</strong>. You should always do your best to excel in your job. You can stand out from the crowd by adding value to your contributions to the company. How are you improving efficiency, saving money, bringing in new revenue? To get a chance at that promotion, you need to be the employee that gives more every day, willing to take new responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show leadership and be a team player</strong>. Showing that you are a team player and can take leadership roles will help you to get noticed by your employer. Strive to be a role model, gain your coworkers respect, and motivate your team members. In other words, display and build qualities that will make you a good leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continue your education</strong>. When developing your career path, consider and plan for future certifications and training. For example, if you are planning to get from Python coder to Data Analyst, plan to earn a new certificate, like the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Check for your company’s Data Analyst job requirements and improve your skills accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain strong work ethics</strong>. Always be punctual for work, have excellent customer service, meet your deadlines, excel at your job, be respectful, and collaborate with your coworkers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communicate with your boss, your coworkers, and your customers</strong>. Good communication is a key characteristic to display in any type of job, but when you are looking for a promotion, you need to excel in the way you communicate. It is crucial to know how to communicate. It will help when planning for your career path and add some communication training to your skill development.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preparing-your-resume">Preparing your Resume</h2>
<h3 id="tailor-your-resume">Tailor your resume</h3>
<p>As you prepare for your job search, you will need to create or update your resume to reflect your experience in order to apply for roles like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automation Engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry-level Python Developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT Support Specialist II</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry-level Software Engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network Engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…and other similar job titles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have learned so much during this certificate program, and it is important that your resume reflects that. An effective resume highlights your skills and experience and is tailored to the position you are applying for. Let’s explore how to make your resume stand out by incorporating your new Python automation skills and your previous experience.</p>
<h4 id="tailor-the-content">Tailor the content</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify what is important to the potential employer</strong>. What does the employer want to know about you? Make sure that you carefully read the job description and notice which skills are mentioned. You can also read several job descriptions for the same type of role to identify which skills and requirements show up frequently. For instance, although specifics will vary by role and employer, many Python automation-related roles require the ability to effectively organize and coordinate across teams and projects, manage multiple tasks simultaneously, and communicate effectively. You should take note of these skills and be sure to highlight them using similar terms on your resume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create one primary resume to edit and tailor to each job application</strong>. You should make sure that the order of your skills and qualifications matches the job description. In doing this, you are making sure that the things that are most important to the employer are at the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match the language used in the job description</strong>. Some employers use automation software to filter resumes. If the job description uses keywords like cloud services and risk management, make sure your resume uses those keywords, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Python automation terminology</strong>. This will help the hiring manager reading your resume understand how your past experience is relevant to the role for which you are applying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decide what not to include on your resume</strong>. You may have some skills that are important to you, but those same skills may confuse or distract the hiring managers reading your resume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlight how your experience and skills are relevant to the job</strong>. If you have been working as an IT Support Specialist but want to become a Python Automation Engineer, your troubleshooting skills will be essential in your new role. Make sure to point out how those skills will be beneficial to the employer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="choose-an-appropriate-format">Choose an appropriate format</h4>
<p>No matter what layout or template you choose for your resume, there are several things you should keep in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The design of your resume should be simple and easy to understand for both human and artificial intelligence readers. You don’t want your resume to be discarded before a real person has a chance to read it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your resume should be easy to read and communicate all of the important information in short bullet points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your resume should be one- to two-pages long and contain only the last ten to fifteen years of relevant experience. It is appropriate to use two columns on a one-page resume, but if your resume is two pages, be sure to use the entire width of the page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="update-the-relevant-sections">Update the relevant sections</h4>
<p>Once you have determined the appropriate format for your resume, you will need to update each of your resume’s major sections, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contact information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional summary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and certifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Resumes should be written in the third person and should not contain personal pronouns.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss how to incorporate your new skills into these sections of your resume.</p>
<h4 id="contact-information">Contact information</h4>
<p>Your header should contain your contact information and should go at the top of your resume.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Your header should include the following information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your name in a larger font than the rest of your resume</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city and state you live in (you do not need to include your street address for privacy purposes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your phone number and a link to your email address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link to your LinkedIn profile URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links to any other personal websites or portfolios, if applicable to the role you are applying for</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your header should be relevant, simple, and easy to read</strong>. Here is an example of a resume header:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="professional-summary">Professional summary</h4>
<p>Below your header, include a professional summary.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use your summary to set the tone. Your summary should be one to three lines and should clearly state why you are the best candidate for the position. It should showcase the most important things you want the reader to know about you. If you are applying for a new role, you will want to update your industry specialty. You likely have experience that can be related to critical thinking and complex problem solving. You will want to incorporate that relevant experience into your new professional summary. Make sure you tailor your description of yourself to the role you are applying for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merge the description of the role you are applying for with your experience</strong>. Here is an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automation Engineer with two years of demonstrated success in complex problem solving. Skilled in cross-functional collaboration and project execution. Articulate communicator who thrives in a results-driven collaborative environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use keywords from the job description to describe yourself</strong>. If the job description states that the company is looking for a candidate with knowledge of cloud computing, Linux, or Bash scripting, you should add that to your resume—you have gained that knowledge with this certification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your professional introduction, your next sentence should describe how your unique expertise will make you valuable to the employer.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Don’t forget to use this section to highlight something that makes you stand out from other applicants. Use an accomplishment from a previous role to show the employer what you can offer them. Take a look at this example of a professional summary section:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Professional Summary</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Entry-level Automation Engineer. Proficient in Python and Bash scripting, cloud computing, and debugging code. Skilled in collaborating with technical teams to identify and implement solutions for technical issues.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Now that you have your heading and professional summary updates, let’s move on to the core competencies section of your resume.</p>
<h4 id="core-competencies">Core competencies</h4>
<p>Your core competencies should be a bulleted list of the most relevant skills applicable to the position you are applying for.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Scan the job description for core competencies you have gained during this certification and your past experience then use those skills as bullet points in this section. Make sure to keep this section relatively short, with four to eight bullets. Here is an example of a Python Automation Engineer resume core competencies section:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Core competencies</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Python Coding</td>
<td>Git and GitHub</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</td>
<td>Cloud computing with Google Cloud</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automation scripting</td>
<td>Puppet configuration management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Advanced troubleshooting and debugging</td>
<td>Bash Scripting</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Now that you have showcased who you are and what makes you the best candidate for the job, it is time to tell the story of what you have accomplished throughout your career in the professional experience section.</p>
<h4 id="professional-experience">Professional experience</h4>
<p>The professional experience section of your resume provides a summary of the roles and positions you have held in your career. List at least three positions in reverse chronological order and only include what is most relevant to the position you are applying for.</p>
<p>Your professional experience will not change much from previous resumes, because you can’t change the past roles you have held. However, you can possibly rewrite some of your bullets to relate them to your target job’s requirements. Make sure you are tying the industry lingo back to your previous experience to show the reader—usually a hiring manager—how your skills relate to the advertised position. You may be able to use terms like troubleshooting, critical thinking, testing, implementation, and software maintenance to show the reader that your past experience translates to a Python Automation or Software Engineering role, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Make sure your resume conveys how your past accomplishments are valuable to the role you are applying for. Show the reader how you can make a difference in their organization. An easy way to remember this is through the P.A.R.I.S. framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>P</strong>roblem that needed to be solved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>ction(s) I took</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>R</strong>esult of action(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I</strong>mpact on project (users, quality, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S</strong>upporting evidence (awards, bonus, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of a professional experience section from a Python Automation Engineer’s resume:<br>
Education and certificates</p>
<p>Now that the majority of your resume has been updated with your new skills and knowledge, it is time to update your Education and Certifications section. In this section of your resume, you should include any degrees beyond your high school diploma in reverse chronological order. For each degree, list the degree you earned, institution, location, and date of graduation. This section should also list any professional certifications, licenses, or credentials you hold. It is here where you will list your new Google Professional Certificate. Here is an example of an education and credentials section of a Python Automation Engineer resume:</p>
<p>Your resume is now updated and ready to use for your target job! You have revised your professional summary, added newly-acquired core competencies, related past professional experience to your target position, and added this certification to your resume.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: It is always a good idea to have someone review your resume for any spelling or grammatical errors. Recruiters and hiring managers often toss resumes aside that contain typos. Once you are sure your resume is error-free, it is time to start your job search!</p>

<h3 id="add-skills-to-your-resume">Add skills to your resume</h3>
<p>Python automation specialists are expected to have strong technical skills and abilities, so effectively highlighting those skills is a crucial part of crafting your resume. Focus on your skills for this activity. Don’t worry about adding your work experience just yet; you’ll complete that in a future activity.</p>
<h3 id="get-help-from-the-real-world">Get help from the real world</h3>
<p>Reviewing real-world resumes is always a great idea. It can help you get a feel for how others in the industry are representing their experience and skills. You can find resumes on job sites and LinkedIn, or even just by searching for ”Automation Engineer resume” or “Python Developer resume”. There are many ways to represent your technical skills, and taking a moment to understand how other Python automation specialists do this may give you some great ideas!</p>
<h3 id="what-skills-to-add">What skills to add</h3>
<p>The skills section on your resume likely has room for only 2-4 lines or bullet points, so be sure to use this space effectively. You might want to avoid listing soft skills or non-technical skills here. Instead, this is a great chance for you to highlight some of the skills you’ve picked up in these courses, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python Coding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation scripting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bash Scripting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git and GitHub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud computing with Google Cloud</p>
</li>

<h3 id="add-your-work-experience-to-your-resume">Add your work experience to your resume</h3>
<p>One of the most important functions of a resume is communicating your prior work experience to the reader in a favorable light. This can often be challenging, as the one-page format forces job seekers to summarize all of their work experience into a few bullet points. This can make it hard to know what should be included and what should be left off.</p>
<p>The practices below will help you to select and communicate the highlights of your work experience in the shortest, most impactful way possible.</p>
<p>As you think about how to represent your work experience on your resume effectively, remember the best practices you’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus on your accomplishments first, and explain them using the formula <strong>“Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These statements help you communicate the most important things a recruiter or hiring manager is searching for — the impact of your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever possible, use numbers to explain your accomplishments. For example, “a 15% increase in productivity,” is better than “an increase in productivity.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phrase your work experience and duties using <strong>Problem-Action-Result (PAR)</strong> statements.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, instead of saying “Fixed Python code,” phrase it as “Saved the company over $50,000 in a weekend by fixing an error in a Python script.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use examples that highlight <strong>transferable skills</strong> or those skills that can transfer from one job or industry to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is especially important if you are transitioning from another industry into the tech field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, troubleshooting is a skill often used in job descriptions for Automation Engineers. So, highlight examples from your work experience that demonstrate your ability to identify and fix problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The job experience section is the right place to list your <strong>soft skills</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These are non-technical traits and behaviors that relate to how you work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you detail-oriented? Do you have grit and perseverance? Are you a strong critical thinker? Do you have leadership skills?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give an example of how you demonstrated leadership skills on the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a specific example is more effective than simply claiming to have a skill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is almost always the hardest part of crafting a resume, especially if you are transitioning from a different career field. However, if you take a moment to think deeply about your previous work experience, you’ll likely discover that you can find ways to represent your work experiences in a way that highlights your abilities relevant to Python Automation Engineering roles, like critical thinking or complex problem solving.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-interview">Get the interview</h3>
<p>Remember that the goal of a resume is to get an interview. You will have an opportunity to  expand on the details of your knowledge, skills, and experience during that interview. Though you may find it challenging to compress all of the various responsibilities and accomplishments from previous jobs into a few bullet points, focus on communicating succinctly that you are a candidate who understands the needs of the role, and you have the skills and experience to warrant an interview.</p>
<h3 id="sample-experience-description">Sample experience description</h3>
<p>Below is a resume that provides an example of transferable work experience. Notice how it demonstrates factual, measurable successes and job experience that could be relevant to a variety of jobs in a short, concise manner.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="add-your-work-experience">Add your work experience</h3>
<p>Now that you have had some time to think about your work experience, you should add it to your resume, keeping in mind the best practices we shared above, and that creating a resume is a process. You’ll likely come back to work on it multiple times to change things like phrasing or formatting. With effort and time, you’ll eventually get your resume to a place where you’re satisfied with the final result.</p>
<p>If you need inspiration, or want to see how other Python Automation Engineers have structured their resumes, take a moment to search for resumes of real Python Automation Engineers. You can find these easily on sites such as LinkedIn. Seeing how others with your target job title have structured and worded their own resumes may give you valuable insight about more effective ways to highlight your own experience!</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-cover-letter">Writing a Cover Letter</h2>
<p>A <strong>cover letter</strong> is a personal introduction to promote yourself. It serves as a companion document to a resume. Its main purpose is to elaborate on your professional skills, motivations, and why you should be viewed as the best candidate for a job.</p>
<p>There are three types of cover letters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Networking</strong> — Addressed to individuals to ask for their help in finding a job at their company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prospecting</strong> — Addressed to companies to explore all open job opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application</strong> — Addressed to hiring managers to emphasize your fit for a specific job</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This reading focuses on helping you write application cover letters. Employers have “who, what, where, when, why, and how” types of questions when they gather information about job applicants.</p>
<p>Your resume answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>what</strong> you have done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>where</strong> you worked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>when</strong> you were employed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your application cover letter describes in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>who</strong> you are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>why</strong> you want the job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>how</strong> you will be successful in the role</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Not all job applications require a cover letter. When a cover letter is stated as being optional, it’s best to consider how much a cover letter might improve your standing. The following are common situations when people prefer to include a cover letter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When starting out in a career (early career applicant)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making a career transition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When experience, education, or training isn’t an exact match with the listed requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When entering a crowded field of applicants</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people agree that no cover letter is better than a poorly written one! Even if a cover letter has no obvious errors, submitting a few paragraphs with very general statements isn’t going to help you that much. Before you write a cover letter, follow these steps to ensure you create a meaningful one.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-research-the-company-or-organization">Step 1: Research the company or organization</h4>
<p>You can find out a lot about a company from these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Browse the company’s website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the company on social media including LinkedIn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform a search on the company’s financial standing and investors, if applicable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform a search on the company’s known competitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask your relatives, friends, and colleagues what they know about the company</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-2-inventory-the-required-skills-from-the-job-description">Step 2: Inventory the required skills from the job description</h4>
<p>Read the job description carefully and determine what you think are the most important skills for an applicant to have and why.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-prioritize-your-matching-skills-from-strongest-to-weakest">Step 3: Prioritize your matching skills from strongest to weakest</h4>
<p>Based on the skills you identified in the previous step, identify your skills that match or are most closely aligned (associated) with them. Next, prioritize your matching skills from the strongest to the weakest. People often skip this ordering process. Ranking your skills enables you to emphasize your strongest skills first in your cover letter.</p>
<h3 id="parts-of-a-cover-letter">Parts of a cover letter</h3>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: A cover letter is between 250-400 words in length and doesn’t exceed one page.</p>
<p>Review the goals for each section of a cover letter below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary goals of the introduction section of a cover letter are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the position you’re applying for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show your enthusiasm for the company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage people on the hiring team to learn more about you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong> <em>I’m applying for the Python Developer position, and can’t imagine a more exciting role. As a frequent and avid user of your services, I’m eager to pursue this career opportunity.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body Section</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the body section of a cover letter is to describe how your skills apply to the open position. Suppose the job description has these qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience with Python scripting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 1 year of IT troubleshooting experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical thinking skills with ability to solve complex problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example shows how you can map your experiences to these qualifications in the body of your cover letter.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> <em>I completed the Google xxx Professional certificate and have previous customer service experience in retail electronics. I was responsible for helping customers choose the right devices for their needs, and solve any problems they had with those devices. I also helped keep the onsite computers healthy by identifying and solving any technical problems. With my attention to detail, I can help your IT team solve problems quickly and efficiently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Avoid the temptation to rehash the content of your resume. A warning sign is if your cover letter has essentially the same information as your resume but in a paragraph format.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Focus on what you can do for the company rather than on how you would benefit from being hired for that position. The difference between being company-focused and self-focused can be subtle, as in the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I would like to develop automation solutions to keep your company’s IT structure solid and provide efficiency to the company’s IT systems (<strong>company-focused</strong>; what you will do for the company).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to grow my Python skills by developing cloud automation solutions for efficient virtual machine management (<strong>self-focused</strong>; what you would like to gain by being in the role).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the closing section of a cover letter is to restate your interest in the company and position. It is also used to indicate your expectations, such as scheduling an interview, being considered for other jobs, or a timeframe for follow up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you for taking the time to review my resume for this position. I’m confident I can excel in this role using my combined work experience and skills from the Google yyy Professional Certificate. I’m looking forward to an interview and request the privilege to follow up on my application’s progress in the coming weeks.</em></p>
<h3 id="proofread-your-cover-letter">Proofread your cover letter</h3>
<p>Many errors in cover letters are caused by copying and pasting text from one cover letter to another. After you write your cover letter, proofread it carefully to catch these common things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awkward formality—Few people call people Sir or Madam nowadays, so you shouldn’t use these in your cover letter either. Also refrain from using “To whom it may concern” which sounds highly impersonal. If you don’t know the name of the hiring manager, use “Dear Hiring Team.” Likewise, consider using “Best regards” instead of  “Sincerely” which sounds a little outdated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misspelled words (especially those that sound the same but are spelled differently). For example, “affect” and “effect,” “then” and “than,” and “your” and “you’re.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mismatched skills—Make sure you aren’t incorporating skills for the wrong job description in your cover letter. This happens with copying and pasting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passive voice—Use active voice whenever possible: “I revised the ads” instead of passive voice: “I ensured that the ads were revised.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long anecdotes—Save stories that describe any past results you achieved for when you are  being interviewed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-a-cover-letter-key-takeaways">Writing a Cover Letter Key takeaways</h3>
<p>Cover letters help introduce the best points about yourself to a potential employer. Make sure that your cover letter doesn’t simply rehash the skills outlined in your resume, but adds value by describing how your skills align with the job requirements and how you would be successful in the role. To write the best cover letters, it’s helpful to research the company, identify the most important skills from the job descriptions, and prioritize and include your matching and relevant skills.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-explore-and-determine-your-desired-job">Step 3: Explore and determine your desired job</h4>
<p>Now that you know what industry you’re searching in, it’s time to get specific. For example, if you chose the education industry, you might search for jobs related to automation, cloud computing, or Python coding for a school district or university IT department. You can find similar roles in government, finance, and commercial businesses.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure what kinds of opportunities are available, search for a company in the industry of your choice and review the career opportunities for Python automation roles. Once you’ve found a job you are interested in, record the company, job title in the appropriate columns. Paste the link to the job description under <strong>Job Link</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-track-your-networking">Step 4: Track your networking</h4>
<p>Networking can be a great tool that can lead to potential job opportunities. If you apply for a job through a referral, record the name and contact information of the person who referred you under <strong>Referral Name</strong> and <strong>Referral Contact Information</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="step-5-customize-your-resume-and-apply">Step 5: Customize your resume and apply</h4>
<p>Tailor your resume and cover letter to reflect the language used in the job description and apply as soon as possible. Once you’ve applied to the job, identify the resume you used under <strong>Resume Used</strong> and the date on which you applied under <strong>Date Applied</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="step-6-prepare-for-and-schedule-your-first-interview">Step 6: Prepare for and schedule your first interview</h4>
<p>If you schedule an interview with a recruiter, record the interview date, your interviewer’s name, and your interviewer’s contact information in the next three columns.</p>
<h4 id="step-7-thank-your-interviewer">Step 7: Thank your interviewer</h4>
<p>Once you’ve successfully completed your first interview, make sure to send a thank you email to your interviewer within 24 hours. Remind them of who you are, what job you applied for, and thank them for their time. Your interviewer will likely appreciate your courtesy, which will make you more memorable.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to record the date you send the thank you email under <strong>Follow-up Email Date</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 8: Prepare for further interviews</p>
<p>As you move forward in the application process, you will likely have at least one or two more interviews. Log any further information in remaining columns.</p>
<h4 id="step-9-keep-trying">Step 9: Keep trying</h4>
<p>Successfully applying to and landing a job is a competitive and difficult process. No matter the outcome of a certain application, persistence pays off!</p>
<h3 id="part-2---cultivate-and-maintain-your-networking-relationships">Part 2 - Cultivate and maintain your networking relationships</h3>
<p>Networking is a critical tool in your job search, as it can help you learn about new job opportunities, gain information on your target industry, and help open doors for your career. Cultivate your network of former and current coworkers, and use online networking platforms like LinkedIn to connect to others in your target industry. Letting your network know about your interests could lead to informational interviews with those in your target field, or referrals for job openings. Be sure to keep track of each connection you make, and each new opportunity that arises.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-open-tab-2-of-the-template">Step 1: Open Tab 2 of the template</h4>
<p>Now, go to the <strong>Network Tracker</strong> tab.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-fill-in-personal-contact-information">Step 2: Fill in personal contact information</h4>
<p>Once you’ve connected with someone, you should track your relationship with them. Record the date of your first meeting, the person’s name, and their contact information in the first three columns.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-record-professional-takeaways">Step 3: Record professional takeaways</h4>
<p>Make note of anything new you learned about the industry or job from your conversation under <strong>Key Questions</strong>. Pay close attention to any issues that your contact deems important.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-recollect-on-common-ground">Step 4: Recollect on common ground</h4>
<p>It is also helpful to remember interesting details or stories from your conversation, both personal and professional. Write down any professional tips, common interests, or fun facts from your conversation under <strong>Professional Takeaways</strong> and <strong>Personal Talking Points</strong>. You can use these details to build on your connection with your contact the next time you connect with them.</p>
<h4 id="step-5-brainstorm-further-questions">Step 5: Brainstorm further questions</h4>
<p>You will most likely have more questions after your first networking session. Record these under <strong>Further Questions</strong>. You can use these questions to reconnect with your contact or ask future contacts.</p>
<h4 id="step-6-schedule-your-next-meeting">Step 6: Schedule your next meeting</h4>
<p>Estimate the date you next want to reach out to your contact. After your first meeting, the six-month mark is a good choice, although it could be sooner depending on your level of connection or if you agreed on next steps when speaking with them. Record the date you plan to reach out again under <strong>Next Outreach</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Save the template</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the job search plan template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-include-in-your-response">What to Include in Your Response</h3>

<h2 id="personal-branding">Personal Branding</h2>
<p>Having a good resume and an excellent elevator pitch are important. They will show employers your skills and your work history, and they will give you a chance to impress employers with what you have done, and what you can do for them. There is one more step you can take to make sure you stand out from other candidates. Having your own personal brand will make you unique and help you stand out from other candidates. This reading will help you build your own personal brand.</p>
<h3 id="building-your-personal-brand">Building your personal brand</h3>
<p>Your personal brand represents you, so the first part of personal branding is to look at yourself and see what makes you unique. Brands represent what they are. Product makers use branding to help people notice their products, and to develop people’s trust in their products and keep people coming back to them. You need to build a brand that does the same things for you.</p>
<h4 id="taking-an-inventory-of-yourself">Taking an inventory of yourself</h4>
<p>Taking an inventory of your skills, interests, and things that motivate you will give you a start in building your personal brand. You can build an inventory in any order that works best for you. Here are some examples of inventory questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What drives you to pursue the career you chose?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of your talents and skills mean the most to you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is something you did in the past you are very proud of doing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of tasks or projects give you the most energy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about people you admire. What do you admire about them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are examples, but you can use them to make your own inventory questions as well. Write the questions and the answers and keep them in a notebook or journal.</p>
<h4 id="get-to-know-your-audience">Get to know your audience</h4>
<p>Now that you have your personal inventory, get to know your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Study your potential employers and learn all about their organizations. Look for their values and goals and see how you can align your goals and values with theirs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify who their influencers are. Once you know about the companies offering positions, study their needs based on what the job offers say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify who the stakeholders are who have the most interest in your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at your inventory and match what you know about yourself to those companies’ needs. Your talents, your skills, the things that give you energy, your strengths, your knowledge and experience, and the rest of the information you put together in your inventory are all part of the recipe for your personal brand. Now that you have the information you need, you can start putting together your brand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identify-some-challenges-the-companies-are-facing">Identify some challenges the companies are facing</h4>
<p>Branding helps consumers distinguish one service from other similar services. You can expand this branding concept to you and the services you offer as a Python automation specialist.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify some ongoing challenges companies face dealing with IT automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about solutions to those challenges, and how you can offer unique solutions to those challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show potential employers how having you in their organizations will benefit them with your unique IT automation problem solving skills and knowledge of Python coding, cloud computing, and Linux environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="building-your-brand">Building your brand</h4>
<p>Now that you have taken a personal inventory, studied your audience, and identified some challenges your audience of potential employers face in their organizations, you are ready to build your personal brand. Using the information you put together, write one or two sentences that describe you and what you do.</p>
<p>You may need to write a few drafts before you find one you like best. Once you find the one you think is the best, you now have a brand you can use along with resumes, elevator pitches and cover letters to stand out from other candidates.</p>
<h3 id="personal-branding-key-takeaway">Personal Branding Key Takeaway</h3>
<p>Having a good resume and a great elevator pitch will help you impress potential employers, but having a personal brand will help you stand out from all the other candidates. It will give potential employers something to remember you out of all the applicants they are looking at for the position.</p>
<h2 id="it-automation-job-opportunities">IT Automation Job Opportunities</h2>
<p>When you’re searching for a new job, it can be challenging to know where to start — especially if you’re changing careers or starting your first one. In this reading, you’ll learn how to find the right online job board for what you need in an entry-level job, apprenticeship, or internship in IT automation, as well as potential places to network for job opportunities. Ready to get started?<br>
Online job board</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=IT+automation+jobs">Jobs on Google Search</a>. Searching for a job on Google Search is easy — just type your job search terms into the search bar at <a href="http://Google.com">Google.com</a>. Google Search will automatically search for jobs near you with the terms you choose (for example, <strong>IT Automation Engineer</strong>), using your current location.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not interested in staying in your current area or willing to relocate for the right position? You can filter your search. From the Google Search results page, find the jobs search box, headed in blue, and click on the “more jobs” link under the first few results. You’ll go to a search page with more options for filtering and sorting. From there, change the location, job type, employer, or any of the other filters. Click on the button and you’ll see your options, like full-time, contractor, part-time, and internship. Or, click the filter to look for jobs labeled as “work from home.” These are becoming much more common for all types of jobs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google for Jobs is an aggregator, meaning it pulls job postings from all over the internet, including other job search boards, company websites, and government job portals. In other words, it’s extensive!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>. Indeed is another large job aggregator. Anyone can search on the website for free. It has similar filters as Jobs on Google Search. Each job posting includes a brief description of the job and a link to another website to apply. If you register with Indeed, you can create a profile and upload your resume so your searches are more targeted. You can also apply to some jobs directly through Indeed if you have an account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">Glassdoor</a>. Glassdoor has a lot of similar features to Indeed and Jobs on Google Search. To search on Glassdoor, you need to create an account and provide some identifying information, like your job and education background. What sets Glassdoor apart from some of the other sites is the information about the companies posting jobs, including typical salaries for various positions within the company and example questions from interviews. Salaries and reviews are self-reported by Glassdoor’s users who are former and current employees of each company listed, so these reviews can be a useful tool for filling out your application or preparing for an interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/">ZipRecruiter</a>. Like Glassdoor, you need to register to use ZipRecruiter. Employers post their jobs directly to the site, and then ZipRecruiter matches interested applicants, based on their resumes, with the job postings. You can declare your interest in a particular job too, but you often don’t need to do so formally; the employer sees your interest and your resume and decides whether to contact you based on your perceived match for the job. You’ll get a notification if an employer reviews your information. Like most of the major job sites, you can also opt in to receive emails from the website with potential job matches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job boards for IT professionals</strong> (<a href="https://dice.com/jobs">Dice.com</a>, <a href="https://www.techcareers.com/jobs/search">TechCareers.com</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/cat/dev-it">Upwork.com</a>, etc.). Creating a profile and posting your resume to Job boards that are specifically tailored to technical professions may boost your visibility to hiring managers in IT. You will usually find full-time job leads on job boards like <a href="http://Dice.com">Dice.com</a> and <a href="http://TechCareers.com">TechCareers.com</a>. On job boards like <a href="http://Upwork.com">Upwork.com</a>, you advertise yourself and state your hourly rate. Employers search these boards to find contractors for short-term project work. Contractor work is a good option for building work experience through a variety of different types of projects. You can also build a diverse professional network through short assignments. If you make a great impression as a contractor, you may receive offers for more contract work, or you could receive an offer for full-time employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs">Linkedin</a>. You’re likely already very familiar with LinkedIn. If you have already created an account on the professional networking site and filled in your professional background and resume, you’re already halfway to applying for jobs here! You don’t have to register with LinkedIn to look for jobs, but there are a lot of benefits to doing so. Many recruiters and hiring managers use LinkedIn to find potential employees or freelancers; if you’re actively looking for a job, it’s often as simple as signaling that you’re open to opportunities, a setting within your LinkedIn profile page. You can also search for and apply to jobs directly from LinkedIn. Sometimes you’ll be taken to a company website to formally apply; other times, you might just share your profile and interest in the job with the hiring manager and wait for someone to contact you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, the most important things to do for LinkedIn is keep your profile up to date and link to your professional portfolio. One other option: You can ask your connections, either former employers or classmates, to recommend you and write testimonials to be posted on your profile. This reinforces your work ethic as an employee and talents as an IT Automation Engineer.</p>
<p>This list is just a selection of the job-search sites available to you as an IT Automation Engineer. As you click or scroll through each site, you might find benefits or drawbacks to a specific job board that makes it more or less suitable to your needs. If you live in a major city, you’ll probably have plenty of opportunities available to you. If you live in a smaller town, or you want to work remotely, you may have to look a little harder to figure out your options. (There’s always your local newspaper and small businesses near you!) But with any luck, you’ll have a variety of positions to choose from when you’re ready to start your new career.</p>
<h3 id="networking-opportunities">Networking opportunities</h3>
<p>Of course, online job boards aren’t the only option for your job search. Networking, whether it’s in person or online, is a hugely important method for finding jobs in any field, IT automation included.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs">Linkedin</a>. Okay, so you already learned about LinkedIn in this reading. But it’s not just a place to apply for jobs. Recruiters actively seek out potential employees on the site, but you don’t have to wait until they come to you! Connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn is perfectly acceptable. You might look for a recruiter from a local agency you’ve heard good things about; or, if you’re interested in working at a specific company, you can seek out recruiters who work for that organization already. Politely express interest in any open jobs, and see what happens! LinkedIn is also the place to connect with former colleagues, managers, or teachers. Let your network know you’re starting a new career in IT automation. Most people love to help others!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conferences</strong>. Whether they’re online or in person, industry conferences are useful in many ways. You learn more about your field during presentations and panels; you meet other people who are working in the industry; and you connect with hiring managers who are looking to expand their teams. Not everyone goes to a conference looking for a new hire. However, they’re a great opportunity to meet new people, and new connections mean new opportunities for jobs in the future. Search online for IT professional conferences near you or in an area you would be willing to travel to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job fairs</strong>. Job fairs are often hosted by a group of employers that are interested in hiring new talent or advertising their company as a great place to work. Although a job fair isn’t as likely to be focused solely on IT automation, it is likely that companies who attend will need to hire IT Automation Engineers. You might be surprised by who you meet and what roles you can find. To find a job fair near you, check with local high schools, community colleges, universities, and workforce development programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It might seem overwhelming when you begin your job search. There are so many places to look at so many job openings to sort through. But the more you research, the easier it’ll be to pinpoint the exact type of job you’d like to apply for. And you’ll be on your way to snagging that first interview. Get ready, because that day is coming up soon!</p>
<h2 id="recruiters-headhunters-and-staffing-agencies">Recruiters, Headhunters, and Staffing Agencies</h2>
<p>One of the many ways to apply and secure jobs in the IT industry is through recruiters, headhunters, and staffing agencies. Sometimes it’s possible to secure a long-term position for a company by first completing temporary or contract work through a recruitment agency.</p>
<h3 id="recruiters">Recruiters</h3>
<p>There are two primary types of recruiters: external and internal. External recruiters work outside the organization they represent, usually through a recruitment agency. These types of recruiters can help candidates find a multitude of open positions in the industry and work with them on a non-contractual basis until the candidate secures a position. Internal recruiters work with the company of interest. Internal recruiters can help leverage a candidate’s application by assisting them through the hiring process within a specific company.</p>
<h3 id="staffing-agencies">Staffing Agencies</h3>
<p>Staffing agencies assist companies with finding qualified candidates to fulfill their open positions. These positions range anywhere from permanent, to contract, and contract-to-hire. The staffing agencies are responsible for recruiting and sometimes conducting entry-level screening questions on candidates to ensure they are a good fit for the company. If the agency can’t find a suitable fit for the job right away, they may post the job on online job boards on behalf of the company. The company ultimately makes the final decision for who is selected, and the staffing agency assists with the initial onboarding process.</p>
<h3 id="career-coaches">Career Coaches</h3>
<p>Career coaches can greatly assist with helping job seekers hone in their job search and find positions that cater to their strengths and personal values. They can also assist with guiding the candidate through all the ups and downs of the job hunting process, reframing thoughts, challenging limiting beliefs about the job search process, and finding opportunities for professional growth. However, career coaches often cost more than other routes for securing a job. Consider hiring a career coach if you’re experiencing challenges in moving up in your career, securing interviews, receiving offers, or are unsure about what the next steps in your career should look like. There are multiple types of career coaches out there. Conduct research and find the type of coach you’re looking for. Some provide basic services such as resume reviews, editing of cover letters, or LinkedIn profile analysis. Other career coaches will go further and offer live coaching sessions either in person or online, offer additional resources to help you on your journey, and/or a supportive community of other job seekers.</p>
<h2 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h2>
<h3 id="getting-interviews-through-networking">Getting Interviews through Networking</h3>
<p>It can be difficult to land interviews off of a resume alone. There are strategies that can make a big difference in getting results. This advice can help you overcome some of the challenges associated with job boards, such as out-of-date listings and heavy application volumes that can make it hard to stand out.</p>
<p>The idea of networking can seem daunting for many, however there are actionable steps you can take to make the most of your networking efforts. You’ll learn how to find people to connect with, how to schedule and prepare for important conversations, what to talk about, and how to follow up. If some of these strategies and actions feel challenging at first, don’t worry; they get easier over time. Plus, you’ll be getting more interviews, so it will all be worth it!</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-networking">The Importance of Networking</h4>
<p>Learning how to network effectively is a really valuable skill with a wide range of benefits. It’s something you’ll want to continue to focus on, and the connections you make and maintain through strategic networking can have long-lasting positive effects on your career advancement.</p>
<p>Strategic networking can help you overcome some of the challenges associated with online job applications. Some of the benefits of networking include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting accurate information about job availability</strong>. The fact that a role is posted online doesn’t mean that the hiring team is actively reviewing applications. There is often a delay between the time a role is open and the time it’s posted online, as well as the time it is filled and taken down from online job boards. At the same time, there are often open positions that are not (yet) posted online for a variety of reasons. Networking can help you ensure you’ve got up-to-date information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning more details about the role</strong>. Job descriptions are not always precise. As a result, you might end up applying for roles that you think are a good fit but are, in fact, not. Or, you might fail to properly tailor your application to meet the needs of the hiring team. Insider information via networking can help you understand what the team is really looking for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standing out amid the competition</strong>. Once a job is posted to a job board, there are often tens or even hundreds of people applying to it. It can be difficult to stand out. Networking can help you get an early jump on a new opportunity before it’s posted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The networking process described in this guide can help you address all these challenges.</p>
<p>Through a short and focused conversation with someone at your target company, who has insider knowledge of relevant opportunities, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understand the requirements for your target role at that specific company. Jobs with the same title can vary greatly from company to company, and the actual requirements are not always obvious from job descriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain insight into the company’s organizational structure and team culture to learn what’s required for success, and understand how best to position yourself in your application materials and interviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn about ways to monitor and apply for opportunities at that specific company, so you can know exactly what’s available and how to float your application to the top of the pile. You might even be able to get a referral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a relationship with a professional who might be able to help you in your current job search and be a part of your professional network moving forward.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="networking-for-your-job-search-the-process">Networking for Your Job Search: The Process</h4>
<h5 id="how-to-connect-with-the-right-people">How to connect with the right people</h5>
<p>The process of networking for your job search begins with identifying the right people to network with. You are looking for insider information on the role and its application process, as well as other relevant opportunities.</p>
<p>People you select to network with should work in, or close to, your target role at a company you are interested in working for. These people will have the information you need, beyond what’s publicly posted online. They will likely understand the exact skills and qualities the hiring team is looking for. They may know the status of currently open roles and upcoming openings, and they might even be able to connect you directly to the hiring team.</p>
<p>If you are already connected to the right people, you can jump straight to Step 2 below. If you don’t currently know such people, begin with finding and connecting with them as described in Step 1.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Finding the right people</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To begin, put together a list of the companies you’re interested in. The more companies you have on your list, the more people you will be able to reach out to, and the more opportunities that will be available to you. Don’t be surprised if your company list grows to 50 or more companies. It might sound like a lot, but remember that not every company will have the right role available when you need it.</p>
<p>If you are not sure how to identify target companies for your job search, consider the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Search job boards for openings</strong>. If a company has ever posted a relevant role, it’s worth exploring further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Go through your existing contacts and research the companies where they work</strong>. Even if you don’t know anyone in your target role, your personal and professional contacts might be able to introduce you to their relevant coworkers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify a target industry</strong> (e.g., education, technical, finance). If you know one company within that industry, you can perform a search for its competitors to expand your list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Map out companies located in your area</strong> (or companies with a remote workforce, if you are looking to work remotely). You want to make sure you can definitely be considered for any opportunity you uncover.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, your target companies do not need to have open jobs posted—you will find out exactly what is currently available there through your networking conversations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2: Connecting via LinkedIn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you know the companies you are interested in, you can start connecting with relevant people. The method described here uses LinkedIn because it is accessible to most people. You can also ask for introductions from mutual connections, attend professional events to meet people, post in networking communities online, or use any other way you prefer.</p>
<p>To find people through LinkedIn, begin with performing a LinkedIn People Search using your target job title as the search string, and setting a filter for “Current Companies.” See below for an example searching for a Data Analyst at Coursera.</p>
<p>Review the profiles that come up to identify people you want to reach out to. Focus on people you’d like to learn from and that you think you can build a rapport with based on their background, interests, and even their tone of communication.  Keep in mind that people with well-developed LinkedIn profiles—that include profile photos, summaries, and other details—are more likely to reply to you than those who have very basic profiles, because they are likely to be more active LinkedIn users.</p>
<p>Once you identify a person you might be interested in speaking to, send them a connection request with a note explaining why you are reaching out.</p>
<p>Note that some of your connection requests may go unanswered. Don’t get discouraged or take it personally. Many people are too busy or simply don’t monitor their LinkedIn messages. The great thing is that LinkedIn provides you with access to a large number of professionals, and it’s a great idea to reach out to a lot of people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3: Schedule and prepare for the conversation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve established the connection, you can ask your new contact for a time to speak. It is important to be open to communicating via the connection’s preferred approach (in-person, video, phone, in writing, etc.), but ideally, you want to schedule a live conversation. It’s generally a more effective way to build a relationship, and can often make it easier to get your specific questions answered.</p>
<p>Make scheduling easy by suggesting a specific time to speak, offering to work around their calendar, and sending out a calendar invitation with information on how you will connect (phone, video conferencing, etc.).</p>
<p>Note that some people find it easier to provide information in writing. If you don’t get a response to your original request for a conversation, you can follow up by asking whether it would be easier for them to answer a few questions over email. Remember, everyone is different and it’s important to gauge and adjust to the style of the person you are reaching out to!</p>
<p>Don’t be discouraged if someone does not reply to you immediately. People are busy. Since you have already established a connection, it’s a good idea to follow up after a few days, and then again a week later to give them a chance to reply.</p>
<p>If you still don’t hear back after a couple of follow-ups, you can assume this person is too busy at this time to speak with you and move on to other potential contacts. Remember that while this is a process of developing personal connections, it’s also a numbers game, and you should plan to reach out to a lot of people!.</p>
<p>Before moving on, acknowledge your decision to your new contact—a quick note will help ensure there is no awkwardness so you can easily reconnect in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the conversation is on the calendar, it’s time to prepare. Remember, your focus should be on learning about your target role at the company and determining the best ways to connect to new opportunities. Things you’ll want to focus on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the day-to-day like in the role? What is the team structure, how are priorities decided, what do they like about their work, and what do they struggle with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What skills and experiences do the hiring team look for? What is essential, and what is nice-to-have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they think your skills and background are a good fit for the role, or are there ways you can improve your candidacy through education or experience?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the best way to monitor and apply for opportunities? Is there anything coming up that is not yet posted on the careers page?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any other people they can recommend that you speak with?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To inform your questions, you’ll want to conduct thorough research on the person you are speaking with, the company they work at, and your target role. Consider the following sources of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Your contact’s LinkedIn profile, and any information it links to</strong>. Look for information to inform your questions as well as anything that can help you build rapport, such as shared volunteering interests, hobbies, school experience, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job descriptions for your target role at the company</strong> (if available). During the conversation, you’ll have an opportunity to clarify requirements and responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LinkedIn profiles of people working in your target role at the company</strong>. You want to understand their skill sets and backgrounds to get additional insights into what it takes to succeed in this role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Company website</strong>. You should have a good understanding of the company’s mission, business, and anything else they chose to highlight to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Company reviews on platforms such as Glassdoor</strong>. It’s a great idea to see what people are saying about the company, so you can ask more specific questions about the culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>News about the company</strong>. Just in case there is something significant happening at the company, you want to be aware of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Company careers page</strong>. Make sure you know which roles are currently posted so that you can ask about the status, and about applying to them directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 4: Speak with your new contact</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking with strangers does not come naturally to many people. If you are feeling uncomfortable before or during your first few conversations, that’s completely normal! It will get easier with time as you develop the invaluable skill of networking.</p>
<p>Remember that the other person is also going into a conversation with a stranger (you) and might not know what to expect. To make both of you comfortable and to help build rapport, be ready to set the structure for the conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Remind them about who you are, why you reached out, and what your goals are for the conversation</strong>. By this point, you will have done extensive research in preparation for the conversation, but your new contact might not have had the time to look at your profile and doesn’t know why exactly you reached out. Help them out by starting with a brief overview of your background and the reasons for the conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor time</strong>. Conversations like this generally last 15–30 minutes. Make sure you respect the other person’s time by keeping the meeting to the length you had originally agreed upon, unless the other person wants to continue talking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make it about them</strong>. While you are there to learn, the person you are speaking to is being generous with their time, and it’s your responsibility to make them feel valued and appreciated. Explain why you wanted to talk to them and show the research you’ve done. Honest praise and genuine engagement go a long way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Listen more than talk</strong>. Since you are there to learn about their experience and company, the primary focus of the conversation should be on the other person. Some people might be more talkative, while others may need more input from you in order to engage. Ideally, they should be speaking for 50% to 80% of the conversation. Don’t be afraid of short pauses, and be respectful and patient if they need time to gather their thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take note of action items as you go along</strong>. There are many action items that can come out of a conversation like this: you might need to send the other person your resume, they might offer to connect you with someone else, either one of you might want to share articles or resources that come up in the conversation, etc. It’s your responsibility to keep a record of these action items, so you can follow up on your promises and make it easy for the other person to remember theirs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Close the conversation by clarifying what’s next</strong>. Thank them for their time, summarize what you have learned, and go over any action items from the conversation. The goal is to make the other person feel useful and appreciated—after all, they’ve been generous with their time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asking for a referral</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting a referral is an ideal outcome for a networking conversation. However, not every conversation will end in a referral. Sometimes, there will be no role available or the person might not be open to referring you for a variety of reasons. Make sure not to take this personally or push too hard. Their reasons may have nothing to do with you specifically. It’s important to respect their boundaries and comfort levels. It is also important to go into the conversation without the expectation of a referral. Focusing on learning about the role and getting advice from your new connection will take the pressure off you and them.</p>
<p>If, during the course of the conversation, you confirm that there is a role available that you are qualified for, do consider asking for a referral. You should be able to sense from the conversation whether the person thinks you could be a valuable addition to their team and therefore open to referring to you. If you have any doubts about that, provide an easy way for them to say “no” to you to avoid an awkward situation. For example, you can ask, “Would you be able to refer me to this role, or do you recommend I apply online?”</p>
<p>If your contact agrees to refer you, make sure you understand exactly what’s required from you. Depending on the company’s system, you might need to apply through a special referral link, have your contact submit your resume internally on your behalf, or apply online and then have your contact reach out to the relevant member of the hiring team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 5: Follow up</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Always send a thank-you email within a day or two to the person who has been generous enough to share their time and expertise with you. Go beyond the basic “thank you” and reinforce the connection you’ve made by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reiterating what you have learned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following up on your action items from the conversation. Include any materials you had promised to share and list out what else you are going to do based on the conversation (make sure to follow up on those as well when the time comes!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently reminding then about any action items the other person had volunteered for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offering to repay the favor by sharing any information that might be valuable to the person, or offering to connect them with people in your network</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some conversations naturally lead to ongoing relationships where people find a lot in common and naturally stay in touch, while others don’t create enough rapport to solidify the connection. Even if your conversation falls into the second category, as long as you feel that you’d like to keep this person in your active network, there are actions you can take to develop the connection over time. The key to developing your new connection is finding natural touchpoints moving forward. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Share updates on your job search</strong>. Follow up on any advice from the conversation once you have a chance to act on it. Your connection will appreciate that you valued their guidance and will be glad to know if it helped. Also, remember to update and thank them once your job search is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Send interesting information as it comes up</strong>. If you come across an article or information that reminds you of the person, it is a great reason to send them a quick note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage on LinkedIn</strong>. If your new connection is active on LinkedIn, commenting on their posts and updates is a great way to continue the conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add them to your celebrations calendar</strong>. Add them to your holiday mailing list. In addition, if any important dates, such as a birthday, come up in the conversation, make sure to mark your calendar and send your congratulations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do be mindful about your rate and volume of outreach, as you don’t want to overdo it. Make sure to establish a pace that feels right for the relationship.</p>
<h4 id="continue-growing-your-network">Continue Growing Your Network</h4>
<p>You now know how to find, reach out to, and develop relationships with people who can help your job search through insider information. Not every conversation you have will result in an immediate job lead, but many will. Networking is the most reliable way to get interviews, and it’s available to everyone with a LinkedIn account, effective strategies and some grit.</p>
<p>Don’t be discouraged if you don’t feel great about your first few conversations, or if they don’t result in referrals. It is normal to feel uneasy about speaking with strangers, particularly at first. It’s a skill you need to practice. Each conversation you have with an industry professional is a win. You are building one of your most valuable professional assets—your network—one person at a time!</p>
<h2 id="the-interview-process">The Interview Process</h2>
<p>When you are contacted by a recruiter who’s reaching out to schedule a job interview, you might feel a surge of excitement—along with some nerves. It’s normal to feel a bit apprehensive about the interview process. If you have a better idea of what to expect, however, it can help you feel more confident and prepared. This reading will help you understand how the interview process typically works in the field of IT Automation. Although the interview process can vary widely from one company to another, the process covered in this reading is fairly common in the industry.</p>
<h3 id="getting-contacted-by-a-recruiter">Getting contacted by a recruiter</h3>
<p>After you apply for jobs, you may receive a call, email, or message from a recruiter expressing interest in your application and asking to schedule a call or meeting. It’s a good idea to reply to this message as soon as possible—preferably within 24 hours—to show that you are responsive and interested in the position.</p>
<h3 id="preliminary-interview">Preliminary interview</h3>
<p>In most cases, the first step in the interview process is a preliminary interview—sometimes called a screening. This usually involves a conversation with a recruiter over the phone, in person, or on a video call.</p>
<p>The preliminary interview is typically shorter than a regular interview and might only last 20 or 30 minutes. The recruiter will share information about the company and the job opening. Then they’ll ask you questions to help them get to know you better and understand your experience and skills. The recruiter will also hold time for you to ask questions about the job. It’s a good idea to have questions prepared beforehand since asking questions helps demonstrate your interest in the position. You might also think of more questions to ask during the interview.</p>
<p>At the end of the preliminary interview, the recruiter will thank you for your time and usually let you know the next steps. If they don’t mention the next steps, feel free to ask. You can also take this opportunity to thank the recruiter for meeting with you and express your interest in the position.</p>
<p>After the interview, send a thank-you note to the recruiter within 24 hours. Email is often the best way to do this. Express your gratitude for their time and briefly restate why you would be a good fit for the position.</p>
<h3 id="additional-interviews">Additional interviews</h3>
<p>Once you’ve passed the preliminary interview stage, you may be invited for another interview. This interview is typically with the hiring manager, the employee in charge of deciding who will be hired. You may also meet with other individuals on the team, or other managers within the department, in a group interview.</p>
<p>This interview is often longer than the preliminary interview. It could be in person, over the phone, or on a video call.</p>
<p>The interview usually opens with introductions and a brief description of the company and job position. Then, the interviewer will ask you questions about your background, skills, experience, and how you work. Next, you’ll have an opportunity to ask questions about the company, the role, and job expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll hear about next steps and thank everyone for their time as the interview comes to an end.</p>
<p>There may be multiple rounds of interviews, depending on how the company’s interview process works. These additional interviews could be longer, include future teammates or other employees at the company, and feature questions that take more time and thought to answer.</p>
<p>As with the preliminary interview, send a thank you note to the people you interviewed with after each round of interviews. Your thank you note can also be an opportunity to follow up on anything discussed in the interview, such as highlighting a project you worked on, or anything you wish you’d said during the interview but didn’t think of until later.</p>
<h3 id="final-offer">Final offer</h3>
<p>Now comes the exciting part: receiving a job offer from one or more of the companies you interviewed with. The company may reach out to you by phone or email. After the company extends their initial offer, you can negotiate salary or benefits. When the company provides their final offer, you’ll need to decide whether or not to accept it. Feel free to ask for a day or two to make your decision, but let the company know as soon as you’ve decided.</p>
<h3 id="building-perseverance">Building perseverance</h3>
<p>If the company lets you know that you didn’t get the job, take a moment to process the emotions you might feel. If you’d like, you can let the company know that you appreciate the opportunity to have interviewed and that you’d be interested in any future roles that might be a good fit. You can also ask for feedback on what you could do better next time. Although you might not receive a reply, it demonstrates that you are eager to learn and grow.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-process-key-takeaways">The Interview Process Key takeaways</h3>
<p>Interviews are a great opportunity to learn more about a job position and the company you’d be working for. By preparing for the interview process and continuing to persevere in your job search, you’ll be well on your way to building a career in IT Automation.</p>
<h2 id="interviewing-at-different-types-of-companies">Interviewing at Different Types of Companies</h2>
<p>You have been exploring the interview process in IT Automation. No two companies are alike, so you will need to research each company with which you interview. As part of your research, you should learn the size of the company and how long it has been in business. This is because the interview process at larger, more-established companies can differ greatly from that of smaller companies and start-ups. In this reading, we will discuss the common differences between interviews at these types of companies. Knowing these differences can help you prepare and know what to expect, which can ultimately help you make a great impression.</p>
<h3 id="who-conducts-the-interview">Who conducts the interview</h3>
<p>Established companies often have well-developed human resources (HR) departments. Interviews at these companies are likely to be designed or conducted by experienced HR professionals. The application process might involve a series of interviews—from a preliminary interview with an HR associate to interviews with potential teammates to an interview with the actual manager you would work for if you were hired.</p>
<p>Startups and smaller companies, however, may not have an HR department at all. Applicants are likely to be interviewed by someone high up in the company, such as senior leadership or the CEO. Startups are also unlikely to require as many rounds of interviews as larger companies due to limited resources and time constraints.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-interview">Structure of the interview</h3>
<p>Interviewers at established companies will usually ask questions that relate to your technical skills and competence level. These companies want to determine if you will fit well into the available position. The interviewers will generally ask you a series of common interview questions about your experience, training, and how your past roles have prepared you for a position in a company of their size.</p>
<p>At startups and smaller companies, on the other hand, the interviewer may ask a few questions and then allow you to steer the interview’s direction. Interviewers at smaller companies may also pay more attention to your ability to fit into the company culture. Additionally, since these businesses often require that people perform their jobs with less supervision than at more established companies, they tend to seek employees who are independent and proactive. Being able to actively drive the conversation with your own ideas can help display these qualities.</p>
<h3 id="expectations-for-the-role">Expectations for the role</h3>
<p>The interviewer’s expectations for the role might differ based on the company’s size, and you will need to emphasize different competencies based on these expectations. At a small company, for example, you may be expected to take on many roles—perhaps acting as the entire marketing department. At a larger company, you might be asked to mostly perform one task that you do exceptionally well on many projects.</p>
<p>At a larger company, there may be more established processes to follow, and you may often need to get approval from stakeholders to move forward on tasks. At a smaller company, you might have fewer approvals processes to navigate, but you will need to be able to execute tasks with little guidance.</p>
<p>One way you can demonstrate these different competencies is in the way you respond to <strong>behavioral interview questions</strong>. These are types of questions that require you to share a time when you were faced with a particular situation or had to use a certain skill. In an upcoming activity, you will practice a strategy for responding to these types of questions.</p>
<h3 id="length-of-the-process">Length of the process</h3>
<p>Established organizations may require you to go through several interviews before making you a job offer. They do this because they can generally afford to take time to find the best fit for the role. These companies may take three weeks or more to screen and interview applicants.</p>
<p>Startups tend to have a much quicker interview-to-hire process—generally around two weeks. Because people higher up in the company conduct the interviews and make the hiring decisions, not as many rounds of interviews are typically required. Additionally, since smaller companies and startups may have fewer employees available to get the work done, they often aim to fill open positions quickly.</p>
<h3 id="level-of-formality">Level of formality</h3>
<p>Interviews at established companies tend to be more formal and structured than interviews at startups. Since the interviewers generally want to assess all the applicants on the same basic criteria, the process can seem somewhat conventional. Your behavior, dress, and the language you use is generally expected to be more formal in interviews at these companies.</p>
<p>Interviews at startups tend to be more casual. The structure of the interview is looser, and the dress, behavior, and language you are expected to use may be less formal, as well.</p>
<h3 id="interviewing-at-different-types-of-companies-key-takeaways">Interviewing at Different Types of Companies Key takeaways</h3>
<p>The norms discussed in this reading can vary from industry to industry and company to company, so be sure to research the specific company you are interviewing for ahead of time to learn what to expect. This will prepare you for the different aspects of the interview, such as what to wear and the kind of questions you may be asked. But regardless of the company’s size or how long they have been in business, you should always be prepared to share your qualifications and skills, convey what you know about the company and the role, and describe why you would be an excellent fit for the position.</p>
<h2 id="developing-an-elevator-pitch">Developing an Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>When interviewing with potential employers, it’s important to communicate who you are, your value as a Python Developer or Automation Engineer, and what you’re searching for in a job. A simple way to do this is with an <strong>elevator pitch</strong>. An elevator pitch is a short, memorable description that explains an idea, business, or service in an easy-to-understand way, typically in 60 seconds or less (the average amount of time of an elevator ride).</p>
<p>While an elevator pitch is usually specific to an idea or a product, you can also use it to sell yourself as a professional to potential employers. In an interview, a strong elevator pitch can be used to stand out to your interviewer. It can be used to help explain why you’re a good fit for the role, or to answer the popular interview question, “tell me about yourself.” This reading helps you prepare your elevator pitch to sell yourself and the value you can provide as a Python Automation professional.</p>
<h3 id="provide-an-introduction">Provide an introduction</h3>
<p>Start by providing an introduction. Introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first Python automation job, mention some of your past roles with transferable skills. Even if you’re interviewing for your first internship or job in Python automation, it’s important to clarify that this is what you want to do as a career. For example, you could say, “I want to apply my excellent technical problem-solving skills to find and implement automation solutions.”</p>
<h3 id="show-your-excitement">Show your excitement</h3>
<p>This is where you share your passion for the field and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to sell products online, mention that. This is also a good time to talk about your goals. For example, you could say, “I love creating automation solutions because it gives me the opportunity to develop new Python functions. Long term, I’d love to develop my knowledge of automation for cloud management.”</p>
<h3 id="communicate-your-interest-in-the-company">Communicate your interest in the company</h3>
<p>Communicating why you are interested in the company —and not just the role— is a great way to help the interviewer recognize that you are knowledgeable about the company. For example, if you were interviewing for a position for Google’s Software Development team,  you could say, “Google’s Software Development team has the opportunity to work on software applications that the world uses. As a long-time Google App user, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of that mission and provide outstanding Python support.”</p>
<h3 id="elevator-pitch-examples">Elevator Pitch Examples</h3>
<p>To bring the structure of an elevator pitch to life, check out three examples of elevator pitches. The first is by Dan, a Software Developer. The second is Sean, a Marketing Manager on the Google Ads team. The third is by Joi, an Associate Product Marketing Manager.</p>
<h4 id="dan---software-developer">Dan - Software Developer</h4>
<p>I’m Dan, a software developer with 8 years experience developing solutions for logistics. The most recent solution I developed is a database system that prevents large product shipments from being misdirected to the wrong destinations. Outside of my work with logistics, I develop AI software for websites and create websites for clients using that technology. My passion for software development and problem solving is what led me to some of the top logistics organizations. I love solving problems and helping my clients save time and money.</p>
<h4 id="sean---marketing-manager-google-ads">Sean - Marketing Manager, Google Ads</h4>
<p>I’m Sean, a Marketing Manager for Google Ads, with over a decade’s worth of experience in the field of digital marketing, most of that with Google.</p>
<p>When I went to school, I didn’t even know this industry existed. I majored in English because I liked reading and writing. My first employer in digital marketing took a chance on me because of my experience with client management and spreadsheets, and they figured they could teach me about digital marketing. I’m glad the industry and I found each other.</p>
<p>Google is always innovating, which means when you work in this field you never stop learning. My first company actually ran a blog all about the latest changes to Google Ads (then called AdWords), and because of my English degree, I took a keen interest in the blog. In a few months, I was managing the blog, and it was through my posts on that site that Google found me.</p>
<p>It’s been wonderful to be on the team that announces the latest changes and updates to Google Ads. Because of my hands-on experience buying ads myself, I can immediately see how somebody’s workflow will change after an announcement. I love being able to tell Google’s story to our advertisers so that companies of all sizes can continue to find success and grow their businesses.</p>
<h4 id="joi---associate-product-marketing-manager">Joi - Associate Product Marketing Manager</h4>
<p>I’m Joi, an Associate Product Marketing Manager at Google with 10 years experience as a content creator for YouTube and organic social channels.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I run my own beauty e-commerce business, an experience that has helped me develop a plethora of skills around digital marketing and paid advertising, project management and operations.</p>
<p>My entrepreneurial mindset paired with my love for creativity is what led me to a company like Google. I thrive in ambiguity and love strategizing and solving problems from the ground up.</p>
<h3 id="developing-an-elevator-pitch-key-takeaways">Developing an Elevator Pitch Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>Creating a 60 second or less elevator elevator pitch is a great tool to use to quickly share who you are. Use an elevator pitch to introduce yourself to career and business connections in the future. You can even use your elevator pitch in other types of situations, like meeting new friends or new colleagues.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-interviewer-questions">Asking the Interviewer Questions</h2>
<p>In addition to an interviewer asking you questions, it’s important that you ask the interviewer questions as well. Asking questions helps you learn more about the role and it shows your interest in the role.</p>
<p>In this reading, we list several questions you should consider asking your interviewer, and  explain both the intention of the question and the benefits of asking it…</p>
<h3 id="why-ask-your-interviewer-questions">Why ask your interviewer questions?</h3>
<p>One reason to ask your interviewer questions is that it helps you determine if you are interested in the role. One mistake people make in interviews is believing they are the only one being interviewed. Remember, you are also interviewing the organization to determine if you would like to work there! Ask questions to help determine if the organization is a good fit for you.</p>
<p>Another reason to ask questions is that it shows your interest in the role. When possible, make your question specific to the company you are interviewing for. For example, imagine during your pre-interview research, you come across an article discussing the company’s entrepreneurial culture. You can mention that you read about the organization’s entrepreneurial culture. Then, ask how that culture gets represented in the company.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-ask-your-interviewer-questions">When to ask your interviewer questions?</h3>
<p>Often, at the end of the interview, the interviewer will ask you if you have questions. This is the perfect time to ask any questions that were not addressed in the body of the interview. Or, the interview may end without time reserved for questions, and that’s OK, too. It’s typically best to respect the interview time frame rather than ask questions past the time.</p>
<p>If the interviewer doesn’t confirm they will allow time at the end for questions, one way to fit them in before time runs out is to ask during the interview. When asking during an interview, ensure the questions don’t disrupt the flow. For example, if the interviewer mentions available training for the role, you can comment that you are interested in the company’s training. You can then ask them what type of training is available for the position.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are unable to ask any questions during the interview, you can follow-up with an email. Make sure your questions are directly related to the role and related to something you are genuinely interested in.</p>
<h3 id="example-questions-to-ask-your-interviewer">Example questions to ask your interviewer</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>How do you evaluate success in this role?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>This question helps you better understand what skills or qualities make someone successful in the role. If the interviewer mentions skills or qualities you have, you can then discuss how you applied them in your previous experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Can you describe the typical day of someone in this role?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to know the day-to-day activities of the position. Does this match with the type of role you’re interested in? If it doesn’t, the role may not be a fit for you. This question also confirms that the tasks for the role match the job description.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>How would you describe the company’s culture?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>A company culture is the attitudes and behaviors of the company and its employees. Asking this question helps you better understand if the company’s culture is a fit for you. For example, if you’d like to work for a company that supports creativity and encourages new ideas, look for that type of information when someone describes the culture.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>What do you like about working here?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the question about culture, this question provides the positive qualities of a workplace. Ensure these qualities match with what you’re interested in for a work environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Is there any training for the role and how is the training delivered?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in receiving training for a role, consider asking this question. Additionally, you may want to ask how the training will be delivered, such as digitally, in-person, shadowing a current employee, or another method. Shadowing is when you closely observe another employee perform the role.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Do you have any questions or hesitations about my qualifications or experience?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask this question at the end of an interview, it gives you a chance to address any concerns the interviewer may have about your work background. Sometimes the interviewer is interested in a particular experience that you may in fact have, but didn’t include on your resume. This is the perfect question to address that discrepancy.</p>
<h3 id="asking-the-interviewer-questions-key-takeaways">Asking the Interviewer Questions Key takeaways</h3>
<p>When interviewing, you should ask questions to learn more about the organization and show your interest in the role. When doing pre-interview research, write down any questions you may have for the organization or the role. It’s a best practice to have at least four questions prepared before the interview. If there is time available and the question seems appropriate, ask it!</p>
<h2 id="answer-questions-with-the-star-method">Answer Questions with the STAR Method</h2>
<p>The STAR method is a technique for answering interview questions. Responses are structured to describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Situation: Give a brief description of a situation in which you excelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task: Explain the goal of the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action: Describe the specific action(s) you took in the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Result: Tell about the positive results of your actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your STAR responses should focus on your involvement in the situation. Avoid describing the actions and results achieved by someone else.</p>
<h3 id="activity-overview">Activity Overview</h3>
<p>In this activity, you will answer two common behavioral interview questions using the STAR method.</p>
<p>In an interview, you may be asked behavioral interview questions. These types of questions require you to share a time when you were faced with a particular situation or had to practice a certain skill. The STAR method is a helpful strategy for answering behavioral interview questions in a clear, organized, and engaging way. As you’ve learned, STAR stands for “situation,” “task,” “action,” and “result.”</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p>Using the STAR method to answer behavioral interview questions gives interviewers a sense of who you are and why you’ve applied for the role. This method can make your responses easy to follow by providing a logical structure to each story you share. Preparing and practicing responses using the STAR method in advance can also help you feel more confident going into an interview.</p>
<p>In this activity, you will prepare responses to two common behavioral interview questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, you will recall and record notes about experiences you’ve had in the past that demonstrate your key skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you will select two questions from a list of frequently-asked behavioral questions in IT support interviews. You will answer each of these questions using the STAR method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you can practice answering these questions and others aloud in front of a mirror, friend, or family member.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Access the template</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”</p>
<p>Link to template: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R-e6Dgicl6cV-d6YSbxQVSuzpo-NEPHH4eB2mKMN_38/template/preview?usp=sharing">STAR responses</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2: Identify experiences that demonstrate your skills</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Research the most common Python automation related skills that companies are looking for by reviewing job descriptions on platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn Job Search, or CareerBuilder. Then, consider the experiences you’ve had that demonstrate those types of skills. These may be past work experiences, school projects, volunteer positions, or any other relevant activities you’ve done—even the completion of this program.</p>
<p>Add notes on at least three of those experiences to the <strong>Experiences that demonstrate my skills section</strong> of the STAR responses template.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3: Select interview questions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During a job interview, you may be asked behavioral interview questions. Your answers to these questions should demonstrate how you handled a specific situation in the past and indicate how you might handle a similar situation in the future.</p>
<p>Review the list of <strong>Common Behavioral Interview Questions for IT Professionals</strong> on the second page of the STAR responses template. Consider which questions would allow you to describe the experiences you recorded in <strong>Step 2</strong>. Then, select two of the questions to answer, copy them, and paste them in the <strong>Question 1</strong> and <strong>Question 2</strong> sections of the template.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 4: Describe the situation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the STAR method helps organize your responses following a story-like structure. To review, STAR stands for “situation,” “task,” “action,” and “result.”</p>
<p><img src="images/STAR.png" alt="STAR Method"></p>
<p>Begin by describing a particular situation, challenge, or event you experienced. First, review <strong>Question 1</strong> and the experiences you added to the STAR responses template. Select an experience you had that relates to the question. Then, in the <strong>Situation</strong> section, add 2–3 sentences describing the situation. Be as specific as possible, providing enough detail to help the interviewer understand the context in which the situation took place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 5: Describe your task</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, relate that situation to a task that you were required to complete.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Task</strong> section, add 1–2 sentences describing what you were asked to do, how you were involved, or what you were responsible for in the situation. Explain exactly how you fit into the story you’re telling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 6: Explain the actions you took</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you’ve given the interviewer a sense of what your role was, explain the action you took to meet the challenge or solve the problem.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Action</strong> section, add 2–4 sentences describing the action or actions you took to accomplish the task. Give specific details that demonstrate your abilities and skills. This part of your response may take the most time to cover, as you can highlight multiple skills here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 7: Share your results</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, share the results that you achieved.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Results</strong> section, add 2–4 sentences discussing the outcome of the actions you took and the impact you had. Where possible, use data—such as numbers and percentages—to reinforce your response. If you’re sharing an experience that came with challenges, you may also want to share the lessons you learned.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 8: Answer the second question</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat steps 4–7 to answer <strong>Question 2</strong> using the STAR method.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(Optional) Step 9: Practice your responses aloud</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare yourself to answer these types of questions verbally, practice your answers out loud in front of a mirror or with a friend or family member. Try answering additional questions from the list of C<strong>ommon Behavioral Interview Questions for IT Professionals</strong> (on the second page of the STAR responses template) in the same manner.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the STAR responses template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. This template will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-include-in-your-star-response">What to Include in Your STAR Response</h3>

<h2 id="negotiating-the-contract">Negotiating the Contract</h2>
<p>Picture this: you have made it through the end of the interview process and great news – the hiring manager wants to offer you the position. Your first instinct may be to accept the offer without paying attention to all the details in the offer contract. You should resist this instinct and do your due diligence. Read through the offer letter carefully, looking at what is offered aside from salary, compare it with what is expected for the role, and most importantly remember that this is a negotiation, but you have power in this situation. Negotiating a job offer is an essential part of the interview process, even for entry-level roles. Let’s take a closer look at how to be prepared when the time comes.</p>
<h3 id="negotiation-research">Negotiation Research</h3>
<p>Hopefully by this time, you will have done your research on the role - not only on the qualifications for the job, but also the average salary expectations. Knowing the average salary for a Python Automation Engineer in your location is the best way to determine if the offer you received is fair. Keep in mind what makes you stand out as a candidate as it might give you insight as to whether you should ask for more or identify when you have received a generous offer. Always ask for the range that the team is targeting and which components of the offer the company will consider. For example, does the company offer sign-on bonuses? Additional equity? Merit increases? This will give you an idea not just of what you are receiving at the moment but the potential for growth as well.</p>
<h3 id="don’t-just-focus-on-money">Don’t just focus on money</h3>
<p>A salary that compensates you well for your work is great, but you must also consider benefits. You want to keep in mind some of the things that are important to you and whether or not a potential employer can provide access to them as a part of your compensation package. This would include sign-on bonuses, vacation days, paid time off, sick days, retirement plans, healthcare coverage, and more. If they are unable to increase your starting salary, you may want to explore asking for benefits or more perks to be included in your starting package.</p>
<h3 id="negotiate">Negotiate</h3>
<p>In certain cases, you might be asked if you have a rate or salary range in mind at the beginning of the interview process. While this question might seem straightforward, it is important to not respond with a specific number before knowing the actual number for the role because the moment you do, you will be giving up negotiating power.</p>
<p>A contract negotiation often starts with the potential employer providing you with an offer letter with general details about your compensation package. This is their initial offer and companies will often expect your request changes to the package, whether it be more money or additional benefits. This is referred to as a counter-offer. Once a counter-offer is made the potential employer will try to reconcile what you are asking for with what they initially proposed and find a middle ground if possible.</p>
<p>Always remember that negotiation is your right and it is not considered impolite. On the contrary, showing initiative in negotiating displays your confidence and tenacity to advocate for yourself. If you react with a well-researched counteroffer, it will also demonstrate that you are intelligent enough to know your value.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-long-term-growth">Focus on long-term growth</h3>
<p>While a negotiated offer is common, don’t be discouraged if your counter offer is not met.  Unless you have competing offers, you will likely still decide to take the job if it’s a fair offer. If it makes practical sense to take the initial offer, you should consider reevaluating in 12 months or whenever you have amassed more experience and will have more leverage to work with.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the following video, which will demonstrate an interview where the candidate displays their negotiating abilities.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-job">On the Job</h2>
<h3 id="social-emotional-skills">Social Emotional Skills</h3>
<p>Employers are seeking candidates who bring a combination of social skills and emotional intelligence skills in addition to the traditional technical skills. Being a good communicator and developing positive relationships with coworkers help employees stand out. Possessing good social and emotional skills will help leverage all your relationships from personal to professional.</p>
<p>Prioritizing your workload is a critical skill that will save you a lot of time, stress, and can help you prevent burnout in the long haul. There are multiple tools, apps, and online resources that can assist with time management, to-do’s, and tasks. Find a method or approach that works for you. There is no one solution that works for everyone, stay curious about different approaches to your organization and time management strategy. Break your big projects and tasks into smaller tasks to make it more manageable and more rewarding. Focus on what outcomes you want to achieve by completing a specific task or goal.</p>
<p>Procrastination is a major hindrance to productivity and work satisfaction. While it is normal to experience a little bit of procrastination, it is detrimental if it means you are completing the majority of your work very close to proposed deadlines, working overtime, experiencing troubles with focus, or work on the weekends to make up for lost hours of productivity due to procrastination. Identify things that distract you from your work and reflect back on times when you did procrastinate. What were some common items, events, or settings that distracted you from focusing on your work? Our work environment has a big influence on our focus and productivity. Workplaces that have a lot of decorations, pictures, pets looking for our attention, loud music playing in the room, or working in a busy cafe are some examples of environments that can distract us. Notice what settings you feel the most productive in and aspire to create a work environment that emulates that. Everyone is different, approach this exploration with an open mind and make it work for you.</p>
<p>Confidence is at the cornerstone of success. It’s a critical skill that will help you be seen as a leader within your workplace and eventually lead to more opportunities for advancement or raises. Carrying yourself with confidence will help you earn respect from teammates and clients. Your confidence will guide them to trust your expertise to a greater degree. Regulating emotions also goes a long way in career success.</p>
<p>Practicing empathy with coworkers and clients further develops a positive relationship with them. Everyone loves to feel like they’re understood and supported in their endeavors. It’s equally important that you take time to practice self-compassion and self-forgiveness. If you ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of tasks you have to complete or don’t understand the nature of your assignment, always reach out to your colleagues and supervisors for assistance. You are not in it alone and everyone in the IT field has been a novice at some point in their career. Reach out to your team to gain clarification on the expectations for your role, brainstorm ideas about making your work more efficient, or revising your workload if you are assigned more than what you’re able to complete without burnout.</p>
<h3 id="working-from-home">Working from home</h3>
<p>Working from home is increasing in popularity. Every day, more and more employees want to work from home. At the same time, more and more companies are evaluating the pros and cons of having employees work from the comfort of their homes and are looking for options they can provide to their employees, such as working from home full time or developing a hybrid model.</p>
<p>Working from home has its benefits. You are independent, no longer commuting, more productive. You save money on gas and clothing while being able to have more quality time with family and friends, an improved work-life balance, a flexible schedule, and more job opportunities, to mention a few.</p>
<p>What about a hybrid model? A hybrid model means some days at home and some days at the office. This raises questions, like how to choose which days to work at home? How many days in a week? A hybrid work schedule is a flexible approach where the employee and the employer agree on a mixed work environment of working from home and working at the office.</p>
<p>However, the reality is, no matter if you are a full time or a hybrid work-from-home employee, you will need to set up your home work environment to suit your job responsibilities.</p>
<p>When working from home, you will need some standard and basic services and accommodations like reliable high-speed internet connection, a computer or laptop, a phone, headset, desk, and chair. Depending on your job, you may also need to have an accessible printer, some specific programs, an extra monitor,  and so on. Also, you will need to have a noise/distraction free environment.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of working from home is scheduling your work week and staying organized. Before starting to work from home, make sure to set some ground rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decide your working hours. When you start your day, when you end it, lunch time, brain breaks, etc. After you decide your working hours, try to stick to them as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan your working tasks. Keep track of assignments for the month, the week, and the day. It will keep you organized and help you to meet your deadlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set some working rules to your loved ones. Establish when it is appropriate to get your attention, appropriate noise levels, and what is considered an emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create boundaries between your work and your household chores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how to prioritize your work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have all that you need to start working from home successfully, it is time to learn to take advantage of the tools available to enhance collaboration. There are a few tools that will improve your productivity when working from home. Depending on your job, you will have these tools set up by your employer, or maybe you will have the flexibility to choose the one that is right for you.

<h4 id="interpersonal-communication">Interpersonal Communication</h4>
<p>In your IT career, you will need to use interpersonal communication every day. You will need to speak with other people in the company, including employees, managers, and different people outside the company such as vendors. You may manage a team at some point in your career. This reading will help you build the interpersonal communication skills you can use for everyday communications.</p>
<h5 id="interpersonal-communication-types">Interpersonal Communication Types</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verbal Communication - This is spoken communication. You use this when you  speak to others at the workplace, on the phone, or at virtual meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening - Listening is more than hearing what people say. Listening is focusing on what they are saying, and receiving their messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written communication - Letters, emails, text messages, emojis, and GIFs are all different types of written communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonverbal communication - Gestures, body language, eye contact, facial expressions, and touch are all examples of nonverbal communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some ways to improve interpersonal communication</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a team or an organization to work well, members need to be able to say what they need others to know and to fully understand what others need from them. Here are some tips to help with interpersonal communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be consistent</strong> - Set communication standards and keep them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on professional communication</strong> - Personal communication is unprofessional and takes away time you need for work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid assumptions</strong> - Listen to what the other person says and respond to what the other person is saying. Making assumptions will stop their full message from reaching you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Listen actively</strong> - Carefully listen to what the other person says and fully understand it before you respond. Responding without knowing the message leads to misunderstanding, and it could lead to conflict.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="making-requests">Making Requests</h5>
<p>Members of a team or organization sometimes need to make requests of each other. Effective requests are more likely to get results, and they show team or organization members they can rely on each other. When making requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be sure to know what you are requesting before you make the request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be clear when you make a request - it’s important to communicate exactly what you need from the other person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may need to wait for the right opportunity to make the request if the other person is busy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen carefully to what the other person has to say with an open mind after you make the request if the person denies it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always make requests politely and respectfully.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="when-to-use-which-type-of-communication">When to use which type of communication</h5>
<p>Some communications are done verbally in the workplace or in a virtual meeting. Others are done through phone calls. Some are done through email, messaging, or on paper. Not all communications use written or spoken language. Some communication is nonverbal. Each situation calls for one or more types of communication.</p>
<p>In situations where information has to be given to the whole team, you should share it at the workplace in a meeting or in a virtual meeting using verbal communication.These situations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Announcements the whole team needs to hear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideas and requests for the team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requests for individuals that are not personal such as asking a team member to perform a task for the team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion points that need to be discussed by the team</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A second part of this communication is a group email sent to the team with a recap of the information from the meeting. This will give team members ongoing access to the information, and it will provide the information for any team members who couldn’t attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Use group emails to the team when you have something important to share between meetings. Use text messages when you have short messages for other individuals. You can use personal emails for longer communications.</p>
<p>For communications after hours, or for private conversations between two people, you can have a phone conversation. You can meet the individual in a private office, but private conversations include sensitive information, so be sure to respect the other person’s privacy and have the conversation in a way no one else can hear it or join in. Here are some examples of private conversations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Criticism - Use criticism to help someone else solve a problem, not to hurt them. If you criticize them in front of the team, it will embarrass them, and it can lead to gossip and conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal situations - Someone may come to you with personal information.Treat this as a private communication. If the person wants the team to know, they will share it themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonverbal communication is important. It helps get the message across without words. It can cause problems when the wrong message comes through. When having interpersonal communications at work, try to be careful to avoid too much emotion. Here are some examples of nonverbal cues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Facial expressions - Example: A person says they’re happy, but they have a sad facial expression. People who experience the expression know the person is sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tone of voice - Tone of voice can say more than the words said. For example, when someone says “good job” in an angry tone, it probably means the speaker isn’t happy about what the other person did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye contact - looking directly at the speaker demonstrates to them that you are listening and interested in what they have to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions - Hand movements and other body movements are also communication. If you slam your fist on a table but say you are not angry, people will still know you are angry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="leadership-and-interpersonal-communication">Leadership and Interpersonal Communication</h5>
<p>During your career, you may lead a team or have a supervisory role. Communication skills are essential for a leadership position. You need to be able to communicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expectations - be sure to set realistic expectations, and to clearly communicate them to your staff members. Make sure they understand them and encourage questions if there is something they don’t fully understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking questions - Asking the right questions is important. Be sure you know exactly what information you need before asking questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Examine the problem or situation and decide what you need to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask your question in a tone that demonstrates to the other person that you are interested in the answer. If you ask in an over formal or accusing tone, the other person will feel anxious, and they may not answer fully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask your questions clearly, and focus them on what you need to know. If the questions aren’t clear, or if they aren’t focused on what you need to know, the answers will also be unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively listen to the answer after you ask the question. You need to fully understand what the other person is saying before you react to the information or use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you get the information you need, thank the person who gave you the information. It shows the other person respect, and they will be more likely to answer questions in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="communication-for-introverts">Communication for Introverts</h5>
<p>If you are an introvert, your communication experiences may be different than what extroverts experience. Here are some tips for communication for introverts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think about what you want to know, and ask open ended questions. That will let the other person give you full answers and take on much of the conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use quick greetings and responses to others’ greetings. If someone says, “good morning” to you, say the same. You can acknowledge the greeting without starting a conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare for meetings and team or organizational functions. Think about what you are going to say, and have answers ready for questions you may be asked. If someone asks a question you don’t have an answer prepared for, ask if you can take a little time to think about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cross-cultural-communication">Cross-Cultural Communication</h4>
<p>You will be working with many different people from different cultures and in different time zones all over the world. Cross-cultural communication will help you understand the similarities and differences among different cultural groups and engage with different people from different cultures. For people to work together in teams and organizations, they need to understand each other well across cultures.</p>
<h5 id="working-with-people-from-other-cultures">Working with people from other cultures</h5>
<p>Your teams and organizations will have members from all over the world. There will be cultural differences between you and them. Some things you do will be different from how they do them. Since you are working with them, you need to understand each other to work together efficiently. Here are some ways to improve your cross-cultural communications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research and study the cultures of people you work with. Find out what types of gestures and actions they use for communication. Find out if there are any gestures you use that are offensive to them and avoid those gestures. Find out which gestures they understand and try to use those.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t use slang when having cross-cultural communications. Your slang comes from your culture and other cultures may not understand what it means. In some cases slang from your culture may offend people from other cultures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful with humor. Different cultures have different understandings of humor. What is funny in your culture might not be funny in other cultures. People from those cultures may be confused. Sometimes humor that’s funny in one culture is offensive in others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak slower if someone asks you to, but don’t speak too slow or it may offend the other person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="problems-with-cross-cultural-communication">Problems with cross cultural communication</h5>
<p>Problems happen with cross-cultural communication, but if you know what causes them, you can avoid them. Here are some of the problems that can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gesture problems - Simple gestures in one culture can mean something different in another. You may use a gesture that’s positive in your culture, but is offensive to the person you are communicating with from another culture. In the same way, another culture’s positive gesture may be offensive to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereotyping - Stereotyping is offensive, and it gives you the wrong ideas about cultures. Sometimes well-meaning people mistake stereotypes for knowledge of a culture and use them to communicate with members of that culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misunderstood humor - Most cultures have some form of humor and jokes. People from other cultures might be confused by your joke, or, in some cases, jokes that are funny to you might offend people from other cultures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences in messaging - You might send an email and find it either doesn’t get a response, or the response is slow. Some cultures treat email and other communications differently. You might come from a culture where individuals answer emails right away, but the culture you sent the email to doesn’t respond until their whole team looks at the email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time zone problems - The world has 24 time zones, one for each hour. You need to check where the people you are communicating with are and what time zones they’re in. Problems happen when someone in one time zone calls out at a regular time like 9:00 in the morning, but the person on the other end of the communication has to wake up at 3:00 in the morning to take the communication. The receiver sees this as inconsiderate and it can lead to conflict and lost opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="managing-conflict">Managing Conflict</h4>
<p>When people work together, there will be some miscommunications. Problems with interpersonal communications, cross-cultural communications and clashing thoughts and ideas create conflict. Conflict can make your team inefficient since members have a difficult time working together. Being able to manage conflict will keep conflict from harming productivity and help your team work together toward goals even if they disagree with each other.</p>
<h5 id="why-does-conflict-happen">Why does conflict happen?</h5>
<p>Conflict happens for many reasons. Here are a few of the situations that cause conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personality conflict - Every person is different, and each person has their own personality. Sometimes these personalities clash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work environment problems - Having a negative work environment leads to conflict. It’s important to keep a safe, comfortable work environment to prevent conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpersonal communication problems - Misunderstandings and negative responses to criticism cause conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-cultural communication problems - Cultural misunderstandings and assumptions may create conflicts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-do-i-solve-conflict">How do I solve conflict?</h5>
<p>Conflict is natural when people work together. People have different ideas and disagree. Once conflict happens, you need to solve the conflict before it becomes worse.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Address issues as soon as you see them. Meet with the team members involved with the conflict and listen to what each of them has to say. Give each of them a chance to share their side of the conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be clear about what each side needs and address the situation. Once you know what each side needs and you heard both sides’ information about the conflict, find a resolution that will stop further conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent conflict by keeping a safe, pleasant work environment. Keep the environment positive. Encourage open, friendly communication between team members. If there are minor disagreements, let them share them in an open, positive environment and put them aside before they create bigger problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage team members to share their ideas and cultures with the rest of the team often to promote cultural understanding and prevent cross-cultural communication problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interruptions - Sometimes someone will interrupt you while you are speaking. When you deal with an interrupter:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>When they interrupt you at a meeting or in a conversation, calmly ask them to let you finish your sentence. If you react with hostility, your reaction will create conflict.</p>

<h3 id="impostor-syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</h3>
<p>Professionals in many fields including IT sometimes feel like they don’t belong in their positions. They look at others they work with and feel like the other people are real professionals in the field and they are impostors and are not worthy of their positions. They feel like they got into their fields through luck or timing, and they are worried others will find out they are impostors. This is impostor syndrome. This reading will help you understand impostor syndrome and how to deal with it if you see it in yourself.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-know-if-you-have-impostor-syndrome">How do you know if you have Impostor Syndrome?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You feel like all the success you have in your career came from luck, not learning skills and working hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are afraid someone will discover you are not qualified for your position. Once someone does, you will lose your position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be perceived as dishonest, and you won’t be able to work in your field again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You feel like you need to put a lot of extra effort in to try to be worthy of the position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do something well and your team members or supervisors praise you, you feel you are not worthy of the praise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sometimes don’t try to reach for goals because you feel like they are unattainable goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-deal-with-impostor-syndrome">How to deal with Impostor Syndrome</h4>
<p>First, don’t feel bad about yourself if you have Impostor Syndrome. Many professionals in your field share it with you. There are even Nobel Prize winners who have impostor syndrome. It’s very common. You are not an impostor, though. You worked hard to get this far. Here are some ways to deal with impostor syndrome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look at all you’ve done in the course and in your experiences. Keep a journal of all your accomplishments. Every time you think of another one, write it in the journal. Be sure to include your achievement of successfully completing your Google Professional Certificate. When you feel like an impostor, read through your journal and look at what you have already accomplished. Write down any new accomplishments in the journal as you make them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a teacher - teach someone about your field. Let them ask questions and answer those questions the best you can. You might find out you know a lot more about the field than you thought you did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take out your accomplishment journal sometimes, read it, and celebrate your accomplishments. You can even reward yourself with something you really want and celebrate your success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time you doubt yourself, think about a real problem you solved or an important task you completed successfully on the job. Find something good you did that week. Maybe you were able to troubleshoot a problem others struggled with, and you solved the problem successfully. Acknowledge your accomplishments and you will find plenty of proof you are very worthy of your position, and you are a true professional in your field- not an impostor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="taking-risks">Taking risks</h4>
<p>Once you have beat impostor syndrome and proven to yourself you are worthy of your position, you may fail in a task or on a project and feel like an impostor again, or a failure. Even the most well known professionals, scientists, inventors, and other innovators have failed, and they have failed often. Failure does not make you an impostor. Instead, by learning from your failures, you will become even better at what you do.</p>
<p>To move ahead in your career, sometimes you need to take risks. Here are some tips for dealing with risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you fail at something, learn from the failure. What went wrong, and how can you do it better next time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine each project or task carefully, and think about it succeeding. What is the outcome? It may take a few failed tries to get to that outcome, but if you never start, you will never achieve that outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find others on the team who have done similar projects. Ask them for advice about how they worked on those projects. If the project fails, share what you learned with them and ask them for advice on how to avoid the same problem from happening again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="safe-identity-workspaces">Safe identity workspaces</h4>
<p>Safe identity workspaces are a recent development in workplace environments, and their design lets employees share their ideas freely. In these spaces, employees feel a strong sense of belonging. They feel like essential parts of the team, and are less likely to be intimidated. In your career, you may work in one of these environments, as many companies are moving toward them and away from traditional offices.</p>
<p>In a safe identity workplace, there is a leader, but the leader pays close attention to what the employees have to say and acts on their suggestions and ideas. In some of them, managers and supervisors are open to constructive criticism from the team. All team members in the workspace are treated as equals and encouraged to move forward in their careers.</p>
<h4 id="impostor-syndrome-key-takeaways">Impostor Syndrome Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Impostor Syndrome happens when a professional in a field feels unworthy of their position. People with impostor syndrome are scared someone will find out they are impostors and that they got their positions through luck and timing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can fight impostor syndrome by beating self doubt and using your accomplishments to prove to yourself you are a worthy professional in your field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure is always a possibility, but if you don’t take risks, you won’t move forward in your career. Learn from your failures.</p>

<h3 id="recognizing-burnout">Recognizing Burnout</h3>
<p>Burnout is prevalent in every possible industry and negatively affects work performance, interests in personal life, relationships, and health. Burnout occurs when there is excessive stress surrounding a job. As you progress through your career in IT, it’s important to recognize symptoms of burnout and work on managing the symptoms in advance.</p>
<h4 id="career-burnout">Career Burnout</h4>
<p>Some of the many reasons why burnout occurs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unclear purpose at your work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The job is overly demanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The work is unclear</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are additionally many common signs of burnout. Here are some common signs of burnout that appear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Constantly exhausted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical pain such as migraines, headaches, muscle aches and pains, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer interested or have enough energy to engage in activities outside of work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in your sleep. If you notice you are suddenly sleeping way more or way less than usual, it might be a symptom of burnout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identifying-burnout-triggers">Identifying burnout triggers</h4>
<p>It’s equally important to take time to reflect what is contributing to your burnout symptoms and experiences. A lack of agency is one of the root causes of burnout. A lack of agency occurs when you feel like you’re not in control of your current situation and have no opportunity to either progress in your career at your company, financial restrictions, feeling that there’s not enough time to get things done, or lack of recognition in the workplace. Not getting enough rest or sleep also contributes a lot to burnout. When we don’t get enough sleep, we are not as productive, have troubles focusing, and lower pain tolerance. Do you feel like you are in a constructive community? Feeling like you’re alone in the workplace can lead to burnout. If you’re working at a job that doesn’t give you a sense of purpose, it might be time to reconsider your options. Completing tasks that are not fulfilling to you or utilizing all your skills impact the quality of your work and can lead to burnout.</p>
<h4 id="repairing-causes-of-burnout">Repairing causes of burnout</h4>
<p>One of the main ways to decrease symptoms of burnout is to reframe your thoughts around the current situation. It’s always beneficial too to reach out for help from Human Resources, your supervisors, or other colleagues. For example, if you feel like your work has no sense of purpose, notify your supervisor and ask if there are other tasks or positions within your organization that allow you to work on projects and teams that give you a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Resetting expectations additionally greatly helps with repairing burnout. Take inventory of what the contract deliverables are for your current position, assess whether you are meeting those deliverables, and then take note of your own expectations of the position up until that moment in time.</p>
<h4 id="sustainable-workplaces">Sustainable workplaces</h4>
<p>Working for a company that grants its employees schedule flexibility, mental health resources, and manageable workloads can bring a peace of mind and help your career in the long run by supporting your health and well-being. Flexible schedules allow for employees to attend life events such as medical appointments, family matters, and related matters at times that work best for the employee. Some companies will support mental health days and allow you to take paid time off (PTO) to rest, recover, and recharge.</p>
